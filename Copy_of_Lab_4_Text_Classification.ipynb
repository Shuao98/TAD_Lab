The costs include the direct medical costs and the indirect costs, such as the loss of productivity, which is difficult to quantify. Analyze the cost of asthma treatment in Thailand. Seventy-four asthmatic patients who had exacerbation were enrolled in the present study. Self-answer questionnaires were completed by the subjects including characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and level of asthma control by asthma control test (ACT) score. We evaluated the cost of asthma treatment calculated from direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect medical costs. The average total cost per month was 2,752 Thai baht (US$ 86). The direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect medical costs were 52.39%, 20.73%, and 26.88%, respectively. The direct medical costs accounted for quick-relief medications 11.91% and control medications 36.85% of the total medical cost. Loss of productivity, loss of work caused by asthma exacerbation, was the majority cost of non-medical costs. The average cost of treatment in uncontrolled was higher than partly controlled asthmatic patients but without significant difference. Healthcare payment system and age range affected the total costs of asthma treatment. The direct non-medical costs and indirect medical costs tend to play an important role of asthma treatment. The data suggested that cost savings could be achieved by improving asthma control.\"}]"

It allows you to use a custom colour palette including [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) which is commonly used for making nice plots. Here we use the `Reds` palette, but there are [many more](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/color_palettes.html). Some are recommended for colour-blind audiences or for printing."

The `C` hyperparameter of a Logistic Regression classifier controls a feature known as [regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)).

        "**Congratulations!** We've built a system that can do a good job at identifying articles that discuss clinical trials. You have built a classifier on a training set, tuned it with a validation set and finally evaluated it on a test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "We would now need to decide if the performance of the classifier is good enough to deploy. This will depend on the specific project and users of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that for the clinical trials project, we aim to identify articles that the authors may have forgotten to tag as a clinical trial. Whether or not our system is suitable for deployment depends on how it will be used. For instance:\n",
        " - If we aim to automatically extend a database of clinical trials, we would want to be sure that the data that is inserted is very likely to be about a clinical trial. Otherwise, our database will become unreliable and reduce its utility. In this case, having a system that is high precision, say above 0.9 is desirable. Even if we miss some (i.e., have a lower recall), that might be alright because the alternative is missing these untagged articles anyway. But we'd still probably want reasonable recall (maybe > 0.5), otherwise it may not be worth the cost of deploying and maintaining the model.\n",
        " - If we instead aim to have a comprehensive list of clinical trial articles, high recall is critical. In this case, maybe we would target recall of at least 0.99, but acknowledge the fact that precision may suffer to achieve such recall. To counteract this, we would need to consider including a human in the loop to review the classified articles. To reduce human effort, we would want as high precision as possible while maintaining our target level of recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a trained model, these trade-offs can be made by adjusting the decision threshold. The [ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) or [precision-recall curve](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/precision-recall-curve-ml/) may be helpful for this.
